    <div><h1 class="siteheads">My experience Learning Web development: </h1></div>
    <p class="sitecolor">After joining the college, I have got lots of opportunity to learn new things. One of them include Web designing too. I find web designing a very interesting subject. Since it is a very essential part of the internet getting the chance to study and design website has been a great ride till now. I have had many thick and thins during learning this module but whenever I hit a brick wall there was my module instructor Mr. Ankit Thapa to help me out and whenever he wasnâ€™t available learning from internet helped a lot too. With this module I have learnt the basics of coding and with the help of the assignment I have enhanced my web development skills even more. In this module I have learned everything there is to HTML and CSS. With more practice I think anyone can make a career out of it.  </p>

    <h1 class="siteheads">Making Navigation bar:</h1>
    <p class="sitecolor">This was the most challenging part of the assignment. Making a navigation bar is not what we were used to of. I had many troubles making navigation bar.To make the navigation bar I have taken help from  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEC4kqzNTnM">CodingNepal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLgtucwjVII">"How to Create Responsive Navigation Bar using HTML and CSS"</a>[Accessed 28th Feb,2022]. After learning from them I gave my own try. It may not be that professional but I gave it a shot. I have added an extra javascript file after being inspired from their work.</p>

    <h1 class="siteheads">Making Home Page:</h1>
    <p class="sitecolor">Since we all know first impression is the last impression, the homepage is the front face of a website. I have tried to make it as attractive as possible. For the background image I have taken from <a href="https://archive.org/details/res_drawable-ldpi-v4_epg_timeline_background/res_drawable-ldpi-v4_epg_timeline_background.jpg">Here</a> [Accessed 26th Feb,2022] I have picked this image because the glowing lights in the background fits my dark themed website.
    <ul>
        <li><h2 class="siteheads">Search box:</h1>
            <p class="sitecolor">For the search box I have been inspired by a code snipet from <a href="https://codepen.io/mikedane94/pen/wvowGgJ">Codepen</a>I have made it my own variation.
        <li><h2 class="siteheads">Description box:</h1>
            <p class="sitecolor">I have added a description box in every page to give a brief description about the page and its function.I have given its height of 200px to fit perfectly.</p>
        <li><h2 class="siteheads">Footer:</h1>
            <p class="sitecolor">I have also added footer in bottom of every page. The footer leads to social media handle of mine. To make the footer I have added a CSS toolkit "font awesome" to make the logo of respective social media handle appear. I have taken the font awesome library from <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome">Here</a>and the logo library from <a href="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome">Here</a>[Accessed 27 feb 2022]</p>
            li><h2 class="siteheads">Font:</h1>
            <p class="sitecolor">I have taken the font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Bhai+2">Here</a> It is used all over the assignments</p>
        <li><h2 class="siteheads">Validation:</h1>

    <h1 class="siteheads">Making Portfolio Page:</h1>
    <p class="sitecolor">Portfolio page is where I usually showcase my work to my website viewers. As a page that showcases my skillset is very important as a web developer. I have used multiple grid placeholders to showcase my work. Currently its empty it will progress as I complete more project. I have also added hyperlink to the grid placeholders So after I start to update my portfolio anyone one can click it and open in brief about my work</p>
